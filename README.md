## Task 1
To Check Central Limit Theorem
- building two-modal distribution (like above) generating many points,

- plotting distribution with mean values from many samples

## Task 2
To fit a Polynomial Regression on noisy data
- generating noisy data points (with nonlinear relationship, i.e. mix a model points + noise points),
- using least-square regression or pseudo-inverse or optimize.curve_fit methods (on your choice)

## Description:
This Assignment is run by a single notebook file ```main.ipynb``` in the main folder.
